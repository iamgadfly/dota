                        <answer>If you're selling skins on the Steam Marketplace, the money goes to the service's internal
                            wallet, from which it cannot be withdrawn to the card. Therefore, the real money is more
                            valuable
                            than the amount on the Steam balance. Consequently, on services where you can get money to your
                            card
                            or e-wallet, items will be cheaper. We offer about 60% of the price on the Steam Marketplace,
                            this
                            is the highest percentage among the analog services. If someone offers to buy back skins from
                            you at

                            buy
                            skins cheaper than on Steam. </answer>

                        <answer>All payments are made automatically. The standard time of money transfer is 5 minutes, but
                            usually the money comes quicker. Delays are possible only in case of problems with payment
